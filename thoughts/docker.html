## Two programs

Docker is two programs:
1. Docker Daemon
2. Docker Client (interacts with daemon)

Dameon/Client do not necessarially execute on same host.




## Docker Index

index.docker.io is a central repository of "container images".




## Layers

All Docker images are composed of cumulative layers.

The process by which an image gains a layer:
1. A modification to an image results in a new container, e.g.:

    docker run learn/tutorial apt-get -y ping

2. A commit of the container (id) creates a new image, e.g.:

    docker commit 9382kspejrc learn/ping




## Containers

To be understood as a e.g. box (hence "container") housing a process,
and thus all dependencies like filesystem, ram, shell, libraries, etc.

A Container's process or deps are NOT running *by default*.

You start a container by running a process in it. The container fully starts/stops with this process's life.

For example this:

    docker run learn/tutorial echo 'Hello World'

Starts a container with the process of "echo". "echo" terminates right after echoing the given text. At this termination time, the conatiner stops too.




## Troubleshooting

On OSX a strange error may occur when doing:

    > docker login quay.io
    2014/04/03 10:47:57 Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is 'docker -d' running on this host?

    > sudo docker -d                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       master 5514a8c

This http://docs.quay.io/issues/odd-login-failure.html points to a workaround that has resolved the above:

    > boot2docker restart                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  master 5514a8c
